## Getting Started

### About

Bettermdptools is a package designed to help users get started with [gymnasium](https://gymnasium.farama.org/), a maintained fork of OpenAIâ€™s Gym library. 
Bettermdptools includes planning and reinforcement learning algorithms, useful utilities and plots, environment models for blackjack and cartpole, and starter code for working with gymnasium.

### Install 

pip install or git clone bettermdptools.   

```bash
pip install bettermdptools
```

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jlm429/bettermdptools
```

### Available Environments with Wrappers

`bettermdptools` provides wrappers for both **grid-world** and **non-grid-world** environments. These wrappers enhance the functionality of the original environments, such as discretizing continuous state spaces. Some of these wrappers also allow adjustment of the state space size, such as in Cartpole.

See the [`bettermdptools/envs`](https://jlm429.github.io/bettermdptools/bettermdptools/envs.html) doc for more details.


**Grid World Environments**:
- Frozen Lake
- Taxi

**Non-Grid World Environments**:
- Blackjack
- Cartpole
- Pendulum
- Acrobat

Starter code to get up and running on the gymnasium frozen lake environment. See [bettermdptools/notebooks](notebooks/) for more. The blackjack notebook shows how to use seed.py to set seed for the algorithms.

```python
import gymnasium as gym
from bettermdptools.algorithms.planner import Planner
from bettermdptools.utils.plots import Plots

# make gym environment 
frozen_lake = gym.make('FrozenLake8x8-v1', render_mode=None)

# run VI
V, V_track, pi = Planner(frozen_lake.P).value_iteration()

#plot state values
size=(8,8)
Plots.values_heat_map(V, "Frozen Lake\nValue Iteration State Values", size)
```

## Documentation

In order to document our code, we use [pdoc](https://pdoc.dev/) (NOT `pdoc3`). This generates .html files that can be hosted via the `docs/` directory.

To generate new docs, run:
```bash
pdoc --include-undocumented -d numpy -t docs-templates --output-dir docs bettermdptools
```

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome. All docstrings should be numpy-style so they are parse-able by our autodocumentation tool.
